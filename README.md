# GitXiv
[GitXiv.com](https://gitxiv.com/) - Collaborative Open Computer Science 

## About
In recent years, a highly interesting pattern has emerged: Computer scientists release new research findings on arXiv and just days later, developers release an open-source implementation on GitHub. This pattern is immensely powerful. One could call it collaborative open computer science (cocs).

**GitXiv** is a space to share links to open computer science projects. Countless Github and arXiv links are floating around the web. Its hard to keep track of these gems. GitXiv attempts to solve this problem by offering a collaboratively curated feed of projects. Each project is conveniently presented as **arXiv + Github + Links + Discussion**. Members can submit their findings and let the community rank and discuss it. A regular newsletter makes it easy to stay up-to-date on recent advancements. It´s free and open.

## Wiki
- The aim is, to keep the site as open as possible and let the community shape its future.  
- Check the [GitXiv wiki](https://github.com/samim23/GitXiv/wiki), where we discuss ideas and collaborate.

## Dependencies

#Competitions

##GitXiv Competitions We've all encountered this scenario: A highly interesting research paper gets released but it´s code / data are no where to be found. GitXiv Collaborative Open Computer Science Competitions aims to solve this problem.

"We need to put our papers on arXiv because this is the way the field progresses most quickly." - Yann LeCun

“We need to put our papers on arXiv and code/data on Github because this is the way the field progresses most quickly” - GitXiv
##How does it work?

Submit a research paper where the code/data is missing.
The community discusses it and a competition is created.
The community collaborates and decides who published the code/data first.
The winner is rewarded with exposure on the GitXiv site and newsletter.
##Active Competitions
